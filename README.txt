ABOUT FOUNTAIN MUSIC

Fountain Music is an iTunes visualization which animates a fountain of particles exploding to the music.

ABOUT THE SOURCE

Fountain Music is distributed as an XCode project, which I am fairly sure is directory structure independent at this point.  Parts of the source are rough (a couple unsuccessful attempts at a windows build have been made), but I hope it proves useful.  The files in iTunesVisualAPI are modified versions of the Apple iTunes Visual API from the VizKit project (http://www.imagomat.de/vizkit/), which is in no way affiliated with Binary Minded Software.

A copy of the GPL is included in the LICENSE file.
